# Supervised_Learning

Supervised learning is a category of machine learning that trains using labeled data in order to make new predicitions given a set of feature instances.

Data Files in Lec15_101_20_2022_data_manip.ipynb on NeurIPS 2022 Ariel Data Challenge:

1. **Features 1:** AuxiliaryTable: Star and Planet Parameters (91392,10)
2. **Features 2:** spec_matrix: Wavelength bin [0], Transit depth [1], noise in the transit [2], error in wavelength bin [3] for 52 wavelength bins (91392,52,4)

The entire 91392 values for the spectra data for the challenge were given, however, the file was too large to be uploaded here.

3. **Targets:** FM_Parameter_Table: Consists of Planet Temperature, and log traces concentrations for H2O, CH4, CO2, CO, NH3 (91392,6)
